# Snake
This project is an implementation of the Snake game, created as a way to explore building a graphical game using SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) and C. The goal of the game is to control a snake as it moves around the screen, eating food and growing longer, while avoiding collisions with walls or itself.
