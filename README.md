# Snake

This project is an implementation of the Snake game, created as a way to explore building a graphical game using SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) and C. The goal of the game is to control a snake as it moves around the screen, eating food and growing longer, while avoiding collisions with walls or itself.

## ðŸ§©â€‹ Structure

The project is divided into two main parts:

- **game.c**: contains all the game's algorithmic logic, including snake behavior, collision detection, and movement.
- **renderer.c**: handles the graphical layer added to the game to make it more enjoyable to play, with a clearer display of the score and gameplay.

## ðŸš€ Compilation

The project is compiled using a Makefile.

To compile the Snake game:

```
make
```

To run the game:

```
./snake
```
